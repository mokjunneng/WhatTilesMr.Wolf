# WhatTilesMr.Wolf
## Game description 
The aim of our game is to occupy the most amount of tiles within the set amount of time. However, there is an AI (wolf) on the map which rotates randomly to detect players’ motion. Player must stop moving when detected by AI or 2 of his/her tiles will be converted to his/her opponent. (The wolf will turn based on a random time in seconds.) Players can occupy a tile by stepping onto opponent’s colored tile and the tile will be converted to the player’s color. The game ends in 3 minutes and the player with the most amount of tiles wins.
